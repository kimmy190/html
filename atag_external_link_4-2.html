    <title>atag - external link</title>

    <a href="https://www.google.com/">go to google</a>
    <p>Two types of how to go to an external link, the above one, just using "href" = "website link"
        <br> would direct to the external link in the same webpage, not opening a new blank page for the external site 
        to open. 
        <br> If want to open the new external site in a new page, add the " target="_blank" " line to do so.
    </p>
    <a href="https://www.google.com/" target="_blank">go to gooole(but this opens a new page)</a>
    <p> HTML attributes(속성) provide additional information abt elements, always specified in the start tag. 
        <br>They support each tags in functional/meaningful way.
        <br> so in this case to show a more effective way, the attribute "href" and "target" were used.
