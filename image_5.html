    <img src="./image/amy.jpg" alt="this is an avatar of myself." width="300">
    <p> For the image tag, "img", 
        <br>we are going to use the attribute "src" short for source.
        Then type the file link for the pic. 
        <br> One example would be create an "image" folder inside the folder where the html file are part of,
        then type in the image name. like above. 
        <br>For more , going to add " ./ " in front of the image/--- as that refers 
        to open the image folder from the current folder where the html file is running.
        <br> so itd look like this => " ./image/amy.jpg ", which is an another way to say it.
    </p>
    <img src="../image/amy.jpg" width="20%">
    <p> 
        This is the way where the meaning gets completely different. 
        <br> the " ../ " means the folder that contains the folder of html file is part of. 
        <br>So an upper folder, to make it easy and since from that folder the image folder is not contained directly, 
        indicating that the file route is wrong, so it'd give you an error. 
        <br> For me this showed me a normal pic as this html file was inside an upper file of " html_fe ", 
        <br> however, if this is not the case, where the html file is just a seperate file, the above error would work.
    </p>
    <p>
        So basically it is this : 
    </p>
    <img src="image/meaning_of_sign.jpg">

    <p>
        <h2>HTML attribute : alt</h2>
        In case the image won't load, use another attribute of "alt" to provide some explanations. 
        <br>So the "alt" part shows up when the image cannot be displayed.
        
        <h2>HTML attribute : width & height</h2>
        this is an attribute that controls the size of the image. 
        <br> If use either one of them, it will automatically control the size for you. 
        So for example, if you only write width="300", the height will be automatically 
        adjusted by the proportion of the orginial size of the pic. 
        <br> If write both, it can damaage the actual proportion of the pic
        <br> Also can assign percentage to width and adjust the size. 
    </p>

    <p> 
        <h2>Bringing image from an external site(not folder)</h2>
        go to google and click the google image and open it in a new page. 
        <br> Then the new page link will show the route of the image and copy and paste
        the link and assign it to src.
        (only works in chrome)
        <br> I think the google image is not showing up cuz its white..
    </p>
    <a href="https://www.google.com" target="_blank">
        <img src="https://www.google.com/images/branding/googlelogo/2x/googlelogo_light_color_272x92dp.png">
    </a>
    <p>
        Morover, if put the img tag inside the a tag, and assign the link you want to direct using the attribute href, 
        <br> you will be able to head to the link by clicking the image. 
    </p>
