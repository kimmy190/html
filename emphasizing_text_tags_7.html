    </p>

    <h2>em tag</h2>
    <p>
        It italicizes the text you want to emphasize. Like this: 
        <br><em>I just italicized this sentence.</em>
        <br>Use this to give emphasis on a specific text.
    </p>

    <p>Also, can use both tag tgther. use em tage inside br tag is avaialable and vice versa.
        Moreover, can use the same tag multiple times and mix two tags
    </p>

    <h2>b tag and i tag</h2>
    The two tags that contain meaning is 'strong' and 'em', 
    <br> The other two tags 'b' and 'i' are only used for the visualization purposes.

    <br>strong code and b tage has the same functionality while em tag has the same 
    role with the i tag.
