    <title>p, br tag</title>

<body>
    <p>By this, you create a paragraph. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. A sed eveniet tenetur corrupti laborum, alias quos animi voluptates corporis minus assumenda, mollitia soluta, nostrum nam delectus! Delectus obcaecati eius cum!</p>
    <p>Like this when you use another p tag, there will be a space between the paragraph</p>
    <p>Fun fact of p tag </p>
    <p> 1. p tag takes up the full one line of the web browser so as the size of te browser changes, it automatically changes the line and creates a new one. 
        So depending on the size of the browser, the line of the given paragraph will differ.
    </p>
    <p>
        2. No matter how many spaces you put inside the paragraph, it will consider as just one blank space. So when you enter and make bunch of lines inside the paragraph, won't work.
        So if you want to increase the space, use &nbsp; "(&)nbsp(;)", (without the brackets) which is an entity code of HTML, which has the size of a space bar.(so extra space)
    </p>
    <p>
        When you want to organize the paragraph you are writing inside the p tag, <br>use br tag so it creates a paragraph you want. <br>This is the better way to write the code.
